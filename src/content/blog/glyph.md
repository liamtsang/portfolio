A mobile web app for viewing additional information on relics in museums. Using image recognition on the physical object, museum goers will get to inspect the relic in a digital 3D space, and gain a background story on the time it came from. 

## Intitial Prototypes

These are the initial designs I created when I started the project. They were made in Figma and set the design language I wanted to go with. As I tried creating them in practice, I had to cut some the ideas as there were problems with having them function properly on all devices.

## Camera

The first step in the user journey is the camera screen, which opens the front facing phone on the users phone. This will allow them to simply point at the artifact they would like to learn more about, and using machine learning image detection, the app will bring them to the next page.

## 3D Inspection

This page brings the user into a 3D enviornment that allows them to inspect the artifact in 3D, as well as giving important information such as translations of text.

## Storytelling

This final page explains the context and story of the artifact, with motion animations using 3D assets to visually aid with the text.
