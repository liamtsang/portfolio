	Hi, Iâ€™m Liam. I am a front-end developer and designer who takes the web out of the box. I love creating dynamic and exciting experiences using threejs, p5js and css animations. I've always had a passion for digital design; in kindergarten, I designed and sold customized bookmarks to my classmates. Now I am interested in taking interactive experiences on the web to the next level, by pushing designs outside of the standards set by the print medium. I am currently in my senior year of Integrated Design & Media at NYU and will graduate in the fall.
